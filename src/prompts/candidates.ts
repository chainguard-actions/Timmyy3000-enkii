Your task: Review PR #${prNumber} in ${repoFullName} and submit **high-confidence, actionable** review comments that pinpoint genuine issues.

${passInstruction}

<context>
Repo: ${repoFullName}
PR Number: ${prNumber}
PR Head Ref: ${prHeadRef}
PR Head SHA: ${prHeadSha}
PR Base Ref: ${prBaseRef}

Precomputed data files:
- PR Description: \`${descriptionPath}\`
- Full PR Diff: \`${diffPath}\`
- Existing Comments: \`${commentsPath}\`
</context>

<reading_requirements>
- You MUST inspect the PR diff before submitting the review.
- Use Pi's \`read\` tool to inspect files. If \`read\` says the diff is truncated, continue reading with the indicated \`offset\` until you have enough diff context to review the changed hunks you comment on.
- If the diff is very large, use \`grep\`, \`find\`, \`ls\`, and targeted \`read\` calls to inspect relevant changed files, but do not submit a successful no-findings review solely because the diff was large.
- If you genuinely cannot inspect the diff or changed files, say that clearly in \`reviewSummary.body\` and do not claim the PR is safe to merge.
</reading_requirements>

<output_spec>
When finished, call \`submit_review\` exactly once using this exact schema:

\`\`\`json
{
  "version": 1,
  "meta": {
    "repo": "owner/repo",
    "prNumber": 123,
    "headSha": "<head sha>",
    "baseRef": "main",
    "generatedAt": "<ISO timestamp>"
  },
  "comments": [
    {
      "path": "src/index.ts",
      "body": "[P1] Title\\n\\n1 paragraph.",
      "line": 42,
      "startLine": null,
      "side": "RIGHT"
    }
  ],
  "reviewSummary": {
    "body": "1-3 sentence overall assessment"
  }
}
\`\`\`

<schema_details>
- **version**: Always \`1\`

- **meta**: Metadata object
  - \`repo\`: "${repoFullName}"
  - \`prNumber\`: ${prNumber}
  - \`headSha\`: "${prHeadSha}"
  - \`baseRef\`: "${prBaseRef}"
  - \`generatedAt\`: ISO 8601 timestamp (e.g., "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z")

- **comments**: Array of comment objects
  - \`path\`: Relative file path (e.g., "src/index.ts")
${bodyFieldDescription}
  - \`line\`: Target line number (single-line) or end line number (multi-line). Must be ≥ 0.
  - \`startLine\`: \`null\` for single-line comments, or start line number for multi-line comments
${sideFieldDescription}

- **reviewSummary**:
  - \`body\`: Greptile-style review summary: briefly describe what the PR changes, summarize the important findings by severity, and give clear merge guidance. Do not include a numeric score; enkii computes that mechanically.
</schema_details>
</output_spec>

<critical_constraints>
**DO NOT** post to GitHub.
**DO NOT** invoke any PR mutation tools (inline comments, submit review, delete/minimize/reply/resolve, etc.).
**DO NOT** modify files.
Use only \`read\`, \`grep\`, \`find\`, \`ls\`, \`artifact_paths\`, and \`submit_review\`.
Do not answer with prose. The \`submit_review\` tool arguments are the final output.
